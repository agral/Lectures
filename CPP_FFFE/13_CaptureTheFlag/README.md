# Capture the Flag!
This is the 13th meeting in the CPP\_Friends series. This time we'll go exploring the world of CTF competitions.
We'll take a look at "[Stonks](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/105)" binary exploitation challenge
from [PicoCTF](https://play.picoctf.org/), and - hopefully - solve it!

Note: you need an account to view PicoCTF challenges. The account is free as in free beer, but requires you to provide
a valid e-mail address. [10minutemail](https://10minutemail.com/) is your friend.

Will be carried out on November 26, 2021; in polish.

Polish transcription will be made available **here**.
