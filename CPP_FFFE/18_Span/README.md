# std::span
18th meeting in the *CPP\_FFFE* series. It's a quick demo of a new feature from C++20, `std::span`.

`std::span` is somewhat similar to a `std::string_view` - except it can be used for any contiguous chunk of memory,
and it allows the modification of the underlying data.

# Talk plan
1. An overview of `std::span` features.
2. Testing the basic features on different integral arrays (C-style array, `std::array`, `std::vector<int>`)
3. Discussing various ways of creating a `std::span` instance
4. Demonstration of applying changes via `std::span`s
5. `std::span` for a `std::string`
6. Similarities and differences between a `std::span` and a `std::string_view`

This talk will be carried out in March 2022.
